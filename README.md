IoT-Based Automatic Plant Watering System Using the Blynk Application Team- Ansh Srivastava (21BCE3192), Animesh Dwivedi (21BCE3624)
Overview
This project is an IoT-based Automatic Plant Watering System designed as part of the Design of Smart Cities course. It aims to automate the process of watering plants by monitoring soil moisture levels and activating a water pump when required. The system leverages the ESP8266 microcontroller and Arduino programming to create a cost-effective and efficient solution for smart urban gardening.

Features
Soil Moisture Monitoring: Real-time detection of moisture levels to ensure optimal plant health.
Automated Watering: Water pump activation when soil moisture drops below a predefined threshold.
IoT Integration: Remote monitoring and control capabilities via Wi-Fi-enabled ESP8266.
Low Power Consumption: Optimized design for minimal energy usage.
Components
ESP8266 Microcontroller
Soil Moisture Sensor
Water Pump and Relay Module
Power Supply (3.3V)
Usage
Connect the hardware components as per the provided circuit diagram.
Upload the watering_system.ino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
Power the ESP8266 and start monitoring and controlling the system remotely.
